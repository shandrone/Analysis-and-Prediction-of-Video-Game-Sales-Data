A prediction model has been built to predict global sales number of video games based on regional sales data.
Prediction Model is based on: 
  1.Linear Regression
  2.Logistic Regression
  3.Support Vector Regression
  
Comparision between prediction models with detailed evalution of the algorithms and their effectivenes on this particular model is provided in this notebook to find the best fit.
